				<p>Networking and distributed systems provide the infrastructure for computation, 
				communication and storage involving a heterogeneous and potentially large number of people, hardware devices, and software processes. 
				Issues of concern include performance, security, scalability, functionality, and manageability.
				Our research aims at developing the protocols, system architecture, and underlying principles for these systems.</p>
           
				<h3>Ethernet</h3>
				<p>The ubiquity and popularity of the technology has pushed it outside the LAN and across almost all aspects of network infrastructure Carrier Ethernet (CE) is built on Ethernet technology, 
				which is universally popular and economical. CEâ€™s enhanced Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities and superior resilience make it ideal for both enterprises and carriers</p>
		   
				<h3>CPE</h3>
				<p>Customer premises equipment (CPE) is typically installed to originate, route, or terminate telecommunications betwe en the customer premises and the central office (CO) of the carrier or telcom from which the service is leased.</p>
				
				<h3>4g equment</h3>
				<p>The 4G signal is generally transmitted via three different frequency bands (800MHz, 1800MHz and 2600MHz). We offer suitable 4G antennas for all mentioned frequency bands. Alternatively, you can also find so-called Multiband 4G antennas. 
				These cover all frequency bands simultaneously and can therefore be used as a universal 4G antenna.</p>
				
				<h3>Wi-Fi router</h3>
				<p>combines the networking functions of a wireless access point and a router. A router connects local networks to other local networks or to the Internet. 
				A wireless access point connects devices to the network wirelessly, using radio frequencies in the 900 MHz and 2.4, 3.6, 5, and 60 GHz frequency bands.</p>
				
				<h3>WLC -The</h3>
				<p>Wireless Controller (WLC) series devices provide a single solution to configure, manage and support corporate wireless networks, regardless of their size and locations. 
				The main function of a traditional wireless LAN controller (WLC ) is to configure wireless access points (AP) that connect to it locally.</p>
