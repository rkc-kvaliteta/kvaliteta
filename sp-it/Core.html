				<p>Core signifies the highly functional communication facilities that interconnect primary nodes. 
				The core network delivers routes to exchange information among various sub-networks. When it comes to enterprise networks that serve a single organization, 
				the term backbone is often used instead of core network, whereas when used with service providers the term core network is prominent.</p>
				
				<h3>WDM </h3>
				<p>WDM, has long been the technology of choice for transporting large amounts of data between sites. It increases bandwidth by allowing different data streams to be sent simultaneously over a single optical fiber network. 
				In this way WDM maximizes the usefulness of fiber and helps optimize network investments.</p>
			
				<h3>Ip routing</h3>
				<p>Data is routed from its source to its destination through a series of routers, and across multiple networks. 
				The IP Routing protocols enable routers to build up a forwarding table that correlates final destinations with next hop addresses.</p>
			
				<h3>MPLS </h3>
				<p>(MPLS) enables Enterprises and Service Providers to build next-generation intelligent networks that deliver a wide variety of advanced, value-added services over a single infrastructure. 
				This economical solution can be integrated seamlessly over any existing infrastructure, such as IP, Frame Relay, ATM, or Ethernet.</p>
