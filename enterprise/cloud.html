						<h3>IAAS</h3>
						<p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. It’s one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless.</p>
						<p>
						<p>IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. </p>

						<h3>PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE</h3>
							<p>IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. </p>
							<p>Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure—servers, storage and networking—but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems and more. PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing and updating.</p>

					<h3>CLOUD ORCHESTRATION</h4>
					<p><strong>Cloud computing</strong> is an internet-based computing service in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow centralized data storage, and online access to computer services or resources.
					Using cloud computing, organizations can use shared computing and storage resources rather than building, operating, and improving infrastructure on their own.</p>
					<p>Cloud computing is a model that enables the following features.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Users can provision and release resources on-demand.</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Resources can be scaled up or down automatically, depending on the load.</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Resources are accessible over a network with proper security.</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Cloud service providers can enable a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged based on the type of resources and per usage.</li>
					</ul>

					<!-- <p>Designed to offer seamless integration of workloads & data across multiple locations, with a <i>single pane of glass</i> using the Hybrid Cloud Management Engine.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Unified Self-Service Portal</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Automation</li>
						
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>End-to-End Lifecycle Management</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Role Based Access Management</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Operation with Provisioning</li>

				<h3>OSS/BSS</h3>
					<p>The Operations Support Systems (OSS) and Business Support Systems (BSS) or most often referred to as OSS/BSS, BSS/OSS or simple B/OSS provide network and customer data for back office activities. While the mechanism by which both systems work are similar, their end usage and user groups may vary significantly, depending on the information management setup within an organisation. The OSS systems support internal network requirements such as network planning, maintaining network inventory, provisioning services, configuring network components and managing faults - facilitating and automating the operations, administrations, maintenance and provisioning (OAM&P). The BSS on the other hand provides the capability for dealing with customers, supporting processes such as taking orders, processing bills, and collecting payments.</p>
