					<h3 class="mtop-0"> Face Capture</h3>
					<p>Face Capture is a high-speed real-time ICAO/ISO compliant checking solution for static and streamed image content. It offers a full-fledged software toolbox assuring high-quality output for your facial image analysis and enrolment solutions, and the generation of photos suitable for facial recognition. </p>
					<p>While processing an image stream, the Face Capture enables to detect face(s) in the images based on preset parameters (e.g. Minimal/maximal eye distance), evaluate the pertinent characteristics and extract the chosen frames for further processing.</p>
				</div> 
				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane model" id="Finger-Print">								
					<h3 class="mtop-0"> Finger Print</h3>
					<p>The next-generation biometric-based technology offers a dependable, helpful, and authentic way of verifying/identifying an individual's identity utilizing latest Biometric fingerprint scanner. Fingerprint scanners are being used broadly for enrollment, identification & verification in varied projects where the identity of people is required.fingerprint devices offer superior execution, accuracy, and continuance. Our wide ranges of fingerprint scanner devices deliver quick personality verification with a high level of security in a consistent way for various Citizen or Person identity ventures. Different government schemes in India are as of now utilizing </p>
				</div> 
				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane model" id="IRIS">								
					<h3 class="mtop-0"> IRIS</h3>
					<p>The IRIS Recognition extracts and adds an IRIS template to an initialized user structure. This allows adding multiple irises to one user thus associating more iris images issued from the same iris to the same user.</p>
					<p>It helps to improve the recognition accuracy, useful for multi- iris matching/identification. </p>
					<p>The accuracy of the Iris Recognition enables to balance False Acceptance Rate and False Rejection Rate, and adjust the threshold value of the variance rates (hamming distance). In the authentication process, it calculates the variance rates (hamming distance) when both iris codes are compared. Its mechanism determines accept or deny by setting up a certain threshold value on its variance rates (hamming distance).</p>
				</div> 
				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane model" id="Voice-Capture">								
					<h3 class="mtop-0"> Voice Capture</h3>
					<p>Voice Capture systems work by creating a voice print or “template” of a person’s speech. A template is created, encrypted and stored for future voice verification only when a user opts in or “enrolls”. Typically, the enrollment process is passive, meaning a template can be created in the background during a user’s normal interaction with an application or agent.</p>
					<p>The use of voice biometrics for authentication is increasing in popularity due to improvements in accuracy, fueled largely by advances in AI, and heightened customer expectations for easy and fast access to information. Frequent password-associated data breaches are another reason for broader adoption as companies look for ways to better protect customer data. </p>
				</div> 
				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane model" id="RFID">								
					<h3 class="mtop-0"> RFID</h3>
					<p>RFID is an acronym for Radio Frequency Identification - The use of wireless communications to establish the identity of a physical object. RFID term is used to describe a system that transmits the identity (in the form of a unique serial number – EPC – Electronic Product Code) of an object wirelessly, using radio waves. RFID technology provides wireless identification of people, books or assets. A RFID tag is attached to an object and contains information about that object.</p>

					<h3 class="mtop-0"> Passport</h3>
					<p>This system classifies and authenticates documents without operator intervention by utilizing its internal knowledge base, which includes identification and authentication criteria for various Documents and the vast majority of the world’s passports - even if the items do not comply with international standards for machine-readable documents. The knowledge base also includes document characteristics for numerous other government- and state-issued IDs and visas.</p>

					<h3 class="mtop-0"> CCTV</h3>
					<p>A <b>closed-circuit television camera</b> can produce images or recordings for surveillance or other private purposes. Cameras can be either video cameras, or digital stills cameras. Walter Bruch was the inventor of the CCTV camera. The main purpose of a CCTV camera is to capture light and convert it into a video signal. Underpinning a CCTV camera is a CCD sensor (Charge Coupled Device). The CCD converts light into an electrical signal and then signal processing converts this electrical signal into a video signal that can be recorded or displayed on the screen.</p>

					<h3 class="mtop-0"> Customer Communication</h3>
					<p>Customer communication refers to a business's outbound strategy to communicate with its customers. It is executed through a tool or software that localizes conversations into a central location. Ultimately, this helps marketing, sales, and service teams optimize customer engagement.</p>
					<p>Live interactions are typically recorded on a support ticket or the contact's profile within your team's database. That's because these conversations are completely personalized and are only important to specific customers. Digital interactions, however, can be relevant to your entire customer base.</p>
