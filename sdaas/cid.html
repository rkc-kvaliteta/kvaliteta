				<div class="uwp">
					<h2 class="text-center">UWP</h2>
					<p>Our CiD Framework is created using the flexible Universal Windows Platform. With the UWP app platform for Windows 10, we
						develop apps that reach all Windows 10 devices – PC, tablet, phone, Xbox, HoloLens, Surface Hub and more. It supports a variety
						of interaction models and screen sizes, at the core of UWP apps is the idea that users want their experiences to be mobile
						across ALL their devices, and they want to use whatever device is most convenient or productive for the task at hand.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mvvm">
					<h2 class="text-center">MVVM Pattern</h2>
					<p>The framework uses a Model-View-View- Model (MVVM) pattern to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of
						your application from its UI. Maintaining this separation helps to address numerous development and design issues which can
						make your application much easier to test, maintain, and evolve.</p>

					<p>It also greatly improves code re-use which allows developers and UI designers to collaborate more easily when working ontheir respective parts of the application.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ADI">
					<h2 class="text-center">Active Directory Integration</h2>
					<p>Using Active Directory, the administrator will make sure that user-accessible directories are readable and writable by only Authenticated Users, AD group members, and those with permissions. 
						This will help ensure that files created by a single user are readable and modifiable by other AD users.The administrator is free to be as restrictive or as lenient as their security policy dictates.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="audit">
					<h2 class="text-center">Audit Trail</h2>
					<p>The CiD Framework uses a shadow table for each table that exists in the database. This means every time a record is inserted, updated or deleted in a table, 
						the same record is also inserted in the corresponding shadow table. For inserting the record in the shadow table too, we use triggers on the original table that will fire whenever something happens.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="RMS">
					<h2 class="text-center">Rights Management System</h2>
					<p>The Rights Management System is used in the framework to provide management and development tools that work with industry security technologies including encryption, certificates & authentication to help organizations create 
						reliable nformation protection solutions. Through IRM policies, AD RMS allows individuals & administrators to specify access permissions to documents. This prevents unauthorised people from accessing/viewing sensitive information.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="synch">
					<h2 class="text-center">Synchronization</h2>				
					<p>CiD’s platform uses a powerful metadata model from Microsoft’s Sync Framework, to enable peer-to-peer synchronization of file data with support for arbitrary topologies (client/server, full-mesh, P2P), including support for removable media. It enables
						3rd parties to build file synchronization and roaming scenarios into their end-to-end synchronization solutions without having to
						directly interact with the file system.</p>
						
					<p>Sync modes include</p>
					<ul class="data-ul">
						<li>Online</li>
						<li>Limited Connectivity</li>
						<li>Off-Line Mode - Any changes that you made to files while you are offline are synchronized with the original files when you connect again to the network<li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<h2 class="text-center">Distributed Database</h2>
					<p>The framework uses a lightweight RDBMS to store local data or encrypted data stores. Future versions will support Distributed
						Ledgers for Block-Chain based applications.</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="Data-capture">
					<h2 class="text-center">Data Capture</h2>
					<p>Our Data Capture solutions provides the ability and feature set to automate the process of capturing the data from Paper Documents, Biometrics, Photos and Locations, as well as other purposes.</p>
					<ul class="data-ul">
						<li>	Document or Enterprise Content Management Systems</li>
						<li>	Document Authentication System</li>
						<li>	e-KYC</li>
						<li>	Smart Process Applications</li>
						<li>	Access Control System</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The goal of our solution is to reduce the amount of time spent by the customers in the capture process, and produce metadata or templates along with an image file, and/or OCR text. This information is then migrated to a Document Management, Enterprise CMS or e-KYC or any other systems. These systems often provide a search function, allowing search of the assets, based on the produced metadata, templates and then are viewed using clients.
						Features</p>
					<ul class="data-ul">
						<li>	Barcode Recognition</li>
						<li>	Document Type Identification</li>
						<li>	Separation</li>
						<li>	OCR</li>
						<li>	Web-based Viewing</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="document-auth">
					<h2 class="text-center">Document Authentication</h2>
					<p>Using the CiD Framework, we have developed our own Document Authentication System. We developed this using the document libraries which already comprises of more than 4000 types of document patterns and format from all over the world.</p>
					<p>It will run the following tests on the documents to recognize the type of the document they are:-</p>
					<ul class="data-ul">
						<li>VIZ Reading</li>
						<li>MRZ Reading</li>
						<li>Thread Detect</li>
						<li>Microprint Test</li>
						<li>Colour Check</li>
						<li>B900 Ink Check</li>
						<li>Security Paper Check</li>
						<li>Optically Variable Inks (OVI)</li>
						<li>Optically Variable Devices</li>
						<li>Document Classification</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="e-kyc">
					<h2 class="text-center">e-KYC</h2>
					<p>Based on the results of authentication tests, our software offers you an identity check capability combined with image compliance evaluation, according to the requirements set by ISO standards and ICAO (International Civil Aviation
						Organization) specification. Our software is very effective and very reliable.</p>

					</p>This can process the images that comes from Data Capture solutions like IDs and face to identify them </p>
					<ul class="data-ul">
						<li>Real-time face Detection</li>
						<li>Identity Detection</li>
						<li>Head Pose Deviation</li>
						<li>Quality Assurance</li>
						<li>Detection of closed eye, eyes gaze, red eyes, open mouth, eye glasses and heavy frame glasses</li>
						<li>Multi- threading support</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="text-center">Digital Services</h2>

					<h4>Digitalization</h4>
					<p>The Distributed Data Capture and processing occurs in a de-centralized mode, while the Desktop Software Client works on an offline mode to provide rapid processing for the high-speed scanners,image processing activities such as OCR/ICR/
						Barcode reading, Type Conversion (images to PDFs) and Data Capture.</p>

					<p>An additional feature for security is added for extremely sensitive documents being captured happens post scanning, where a template can be created on which data is needed for extraction. Only the selected areas of the template will be extracted
						and visible for the Data Capture Quality Check process, thus preventing transcribers from seeing the whole document and only the relevant parts. The images of the captured area will be sent to two separate transcribers who will then verify the data.</p>
					<p>If the data matches, the process continues to the next stage otherwise it is sent to a third person for further verification.</p>
