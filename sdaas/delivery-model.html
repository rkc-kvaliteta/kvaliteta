					<h2 class="text-center">Themes</h2>
					<p>For portfolio/product development, storyboards are a simple yet concise way to express business requirements. 
						In an ideal world these stories are broken down as small as possible under one label, categorizing the dependencies, 
						keeping them together. Itâ€™s a harmonizing act. Assigning themes to the User Stories in a portfolio/product backlog helps to see them emerge, 
						which will give extra clarity to the team and business about the Sprint Goals, as they impact partners, 
						key activities, customer segments, revenue streams, and other portfolio business model elements.</p>

				<div class="model">
					<h2 class="text-center">Goals</h2>
					<p>Our methodology focuses on managing deliverables (the User Stories) and how they affect (from output to outcomes). 
						The goals enable a team by changing the focus from creating the features the stakeholders want, 
						to thrive in delivering the Objectives and Key Results agreed with them. It helps to prioritize and deliver pre-defined business results. 
						We adopt leaner approaches in order to measure its impact and adjust accordingly.</p>

				<div class="model">
					<h2 class="text-center">Metrics</h2>
					<p>Our metrics focus on the flow of value from technologies to the business. Metrics gives precise planning, predictable project management, 
						and strong business understanding & insight discovery. It measures the gap between the 
						project estimation and the actual time spent on a project. Quality & on-time delivery determines the success of the development. 
						The measurement of the deviation from estimation helps deliver the best results by holding members accountable for their estimations. 
						Metrics reveals market share, ROI, defect rate, and more, with the most prominent one to deliver valuable insights being the Terms of Quality.</p>

						It sustains and drives faster time-to-market, dramatic increases in productivity and quality, and improvement in team engagement.
