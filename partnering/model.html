						which is pretty much since the beginning of computing. Over the decades, the big difference is where the focus lies; in terms of encouraging 3rd party developers, controlling access to the platform, and who gets paid for delivering the software that runs on top of it and making it accessible from the cloud for a global audience.</p>
